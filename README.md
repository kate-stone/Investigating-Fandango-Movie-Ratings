# Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings

In 2015 Data Journalist Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight published strong evidence to suggest the rating system used by online movie ratings aggregator Fandango was biased and dishonest. Hickey discovered a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML of the page. Fandango attributed the discrepancy to a bug in their system rather than a diliberate act. They claim the bug has now been fixed

The objective of this project is to analyse more recent movie ratings data to see if the discrepency has truely been fixed. The following datasets, which are publicly available on GitHub, will be used to complete the analysis:
- Movie ratings data Walt Hickey used in his article. This data will be used to analyze the characteristics of Fandango's rating system previous to his analysis. Available [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/fandango/fandango_scrape.csv);
- Movie ratings data collected by Dataquest for movies released in 2016 and 2017. This data will be used to analyse the rating system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis. Available [here](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17/blob/master/movie_ratings_16_17.csv).

This project was completed as part of the "Statistics Fundamentals" by [Dataquest](dataquest.io/course/statistics-fundamentals/).
